# Rufus-Py Development Agenda
## DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT 
uv is used for this project. Check out PR: https://github.com/Hog185/Rufus-Py/pull/37
## Conventions:
Proper PR  or Issue link must be provided where relevant.
Errors and Exceptions which halt the usage of the whole program are added to the immediate attention group only.
Other bugs are added to the Immediate attention or further attention group according to priority only.
Suggestions are added to the further attention or Down the line group accordingly.
These are listed with a priority order from higher priority to lower priority. Editors are requested to strictly follow this priority order to maximize efficiency
## To-Do
### Immediate Attention:
- Fix cluster function command and error handling to avoid crash when executed [backend]
- Complete creating the left out formatting functions in formatting.py [backend]
- Troubleshoot all the commands being used using subprocess and pkexec [backend]
- Connect all the existing format functions to the respective gui components [backend + frontend]
## Further attention:
- Start completing the dd flashing and writing functions [backend]
- Work on MBR/GPT and BIOS/UEFI functions probably [backend]
- Troubleshoot those functions and do proper error handling [backend]
- Convert printed errors to gui error messages [frontend]
- Find alternatives to asking for root privilege from user every time a command is to be run [backend]
- Ensure all gui components are connected to their respective functions [frontend + backend]
- Ensure all the data is on the disk before telling the user that the writing is done, if not we must find a way to counter this? [backend]
- Make the cancel button actually work: (no clue how to properly implement yet?) [backend + frontend]
When cancel button is clicked we must stop the ongoing process
We must restore the initial data, label and other stuff or not?
We may possibly remove this feature all together and just warn the user in BIG RED TEXT saying that the changes are irreversible XD (makes the most sense to me)
- Hopefully make the progress bar actually increment like it should. [frontend]

At this stage, the program should be ready for first release.
